## Project Overview
RentIQ is a web-based platform that helps users identify and evaluate rental real estate investment opportunities based on their financial profile. Analyzing rental properties is traditionally a manual, spreadsheet-driven process that requires estimating financing terms, rental income, operating expenses, and long-term returns—making it difficult for individuals to compare multiple listings efficiently or consistently.

This project addresses that problem by combining data-driven financial modeling with personalized ranking and explainable AI. RentIQ evaluates available property listings, models their investment performance, and ranks opportunities based on user-specific inputs such as credit score, budget, and investment strategy. By automating and explaining this analysis, the platform aims to make rental investment decision-making more transparent, scalable, and accessible.
